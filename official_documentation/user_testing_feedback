Person X 
Background: Graduate student in mid-20s, experience working with developing countries in service projects 

We showed Person X our initial ideas and sketched out mockups. Some feedback Person X gave us:
- A simple and navigable UI can be a main value proposition to make personal finance accessible 
- Future iterations would require connecting to government identification forms in various countries to properly show finance and life planning 
  information 
- Having a visual representation of financial distribution is important to transcend language barriers -- hence we implemented the pie chart

  - Conciously spends less than she earns 
  - Avoids unecessary expenses
  - Saves monthly allowance from parents 
  - Plans out monthly expenses in paper journal 
  - Does not have knowledge or experience in investing, but intends to invest afer graduation 
  
  - Phone is the primary device would use for finance management application 
 
Feedback: 
  Home Page: Dollar sign button that was there was awkwardly placed; did not recognize it was a button 
  Porfolio Page: Very clear that it is a portfolio of stocks, but would like stock ticker visuals for each company 
                 Calendar buttons at the bottom of the page are not clear in meaning 
  Future Planning Page: Aesthetically pleasing, and pie chart visual is helfpul 
  Overall: Value proposition of creating a simpler financial planning experience is evident. Would like to see further aesthetic and design streamlining. 



Person B
Background: 19 year old college undergraduate student

Approach to Personal Finance Management: 
  - Plans out monthly expenses in Excel spreadsheet 
  - Familiar with TD and Chase banking mobile apps
  - Does not have knowledge or experience in investing, but intends to invest afer graduation
  - Family members are into investing 
  
  - Phone is the primary device would use for finance management application 
 
Feedback: 
  Weekly Recommendations Page: Fix the alignment of text, since it immediately throws the user off
  Porfolio Page: Not familiar with what 'Derivative' and 'Call Option' mean, add a hovering definition of those terms 
  News Page: Likes the design concept of a color gradient: darker the color of the news article, the more relevant it is 
  Future Planning Page: Aesthetically pleasing, and pie chart visual is helfpul 
  Overall: This app has a much simpler UI than commerical banking apps which have too much functionality. Would like to see a more developed version of this app with features to connect to credit/debit cards and live bank balance information.
