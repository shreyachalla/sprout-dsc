# sprout-dsc
A Georgia Tech Developer Student Club team for 2021 Google Solutions Challenge.

To run application as we ran it: 
1. Clone the main branch 
2. Launch Google Pixel XL API 29 Android Studio emulator 
3. Run without Null Safety from command line with this command line prompt: flutter run --no-sound-null-safety 

Please note:
Code on the main branch is the functioning Front End code. 
The branch called GoogleSignIn-Backend is the functioning code that allows for a Google Sign In to take place. 
In this iteration of the code, the Front End and Back End are not connected. In our video, we first filmed the code on GoogleSignIn-Backend running, and then filmed the code on main branch running, and merged those two video clips together. Upon further iteration and development, we will be integrating front end and back end. 
The other branches, shreya and rita, are not for submission, but rather were used as various team members collaborated on the project.
